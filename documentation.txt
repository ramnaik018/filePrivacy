File Hider Java Project:

     In this project we basically implement hidden locker for Files.
     That being said, we hide files from desktop and store it in a SQL database
     after authenticating via email and OTP .
     When ever we need to retrive those hidden files we can also unhide them from database
     and make them reappear on desktop according to our preferences and needs.
